# Code Refactor

* I made some changes to HTML file and CSS file to to make the code much simpler and easier for the user to read and understand.
*  I used semantic HTML elements and replaced them with the most used elements such as div and replaced them mich more semantic element such as section, aside, and header.
* I also added comments to help the user understand each step as we go through the whole code.
